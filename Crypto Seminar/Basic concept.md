# Encryptions

## IT sec
CIA of data

### Closed protection: Considers all relevant threat to the system

### All around protection: protection methods extending to all elements of the system

### Continuity: The system is protected all times in every environment

### Risk management


# Types of data

### Personal data
- Data related to a real-life person
#### Special Data


### Data of public interest
Everything which is not personal data


# CIA Triad

 - Confidentiality: Secret or personal data cannot become compromised. (get in the hand of entity without rights to see the data)
 - Integrity: Data integrity - Data do not change in an unauthorized way, System integrity - System functions as required, free of unauthorized change
 - Availability: Guarantees that the service is available to the authorized entities at the right time

## Further Security Goals
 - Accountability: entity's activity can be traced back to the entity
 - Assurance: Trust in the system that is satisfies the previous security requirements

##### Authenticity
Source of something that is signals that the content is original
- Entity authentication: Making sure that entity is the one
- Message Auth Code: Making sure that the message is orignial and unchanged by it

# Attacks

## Passive
Data channel interception, monitoring. Does not change data.
- Accessing content of the message
- Traffic analysis
## Active

Modifies the data. 
- Attacker impersonates the sender.
- DoS

## Cryptographic primitives

Algorithms that implement a security goals

- Encryption
- Signautres
- ...

## Cryptographic protocols
Implements security goals for multiple participants.

## Cryptographic Scheme
Sum of primitives and protocols.
